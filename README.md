Using Paper.js to build a game!

If you're playtesting this, open the 'index.html' file to begin.
If nothing happens, try opening it in firefox!


Project SuperJuke is an expansion on the game idea I had built in Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/190007834/)
The goal is to launch a website that will host this competitive multiplayer game.


Thank you for taking a look!
