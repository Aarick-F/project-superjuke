Using Paper.js to build a game!

Right now there isn't anything to "play," but the hope is that this changes very soon!

There is a known issue with the overlay texture in chrome, researching a fix.
Works well in Firefox as of 1/9/18


Project SuperJuke is an expansion on the game idea I had built in Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/190007834/)
The goal is to launch a website that will host this competitive multiplayer game.

CONTROLS:
In the current build, we're limited to 2-player local only while we build mechanics.
Player 1: WASD
Player 2: Arrow-Keys


Thank you for taking a look!
